IMAGE CAPTIONING
technique of generating descriptive text [multi model technique]

input image---->extract feature---->translate feature into text----->Output

based on:

convolution neural network(CNN model)-->extract feature

reccuring neural network(RNN model)-->translate image provided by CNN

Application:

1.Image Search Tools
2.Guidance Device-->scene can be converted to text-->voice 
3.Self Driving Car

*Generate Image Captions fom Images-Restructure VGG16 model
